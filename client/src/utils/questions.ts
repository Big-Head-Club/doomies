    text: `Doomies is an on-chain, turn-based strategy game played on a 9x9 grid. 
    Each Doomie is randomly assigned a score from 1-10 in each of 7 traits (Sadistic, Ruthless, Devious, Conniving, Brutish, Resourceful, and Sneaky) upon spawning in the game. 
    Each turn (24 hrs) you will have the ability to move 1 tile. Whoever inputs their move first will have their move resolved first.
    You can choose to do nothing for a turn.
    If there is no battle for 6 turns, the game will end.`,

    title: 'Battle',
    text: `If two players move onto the same tile, you engage in combat.
    For each attack of 7, a dice is rolled from 1 to 10. Whoever rolls higher wins that round, and the best of 7 wins the battle.
    Be careful where you step!`,

    title: 'Weapons',
    text: `Weapons are randomly spawned in the middle of the board with randomly rolled stats each game.
    All weapons give you a net +3 attack, but across different traits.
    Moving to a tile with a weapon automatically picks it up and when a player dies, the equipped weapon is removed from the game.`,
